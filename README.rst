The ``README.rst`` file should start with a brief description of the repository,
which sets it in the context of other repositories under the ``edx``

codebase.

**April 2019**: this code is **DEPRECATED** since the client project is over. It's also not finished.
The next step, if we ever continue this plug-in, will be to agree on the public APIs required to reimplement this as a maintainable plug-in: [see discussion here](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/16669#issuecomment-439774482).
